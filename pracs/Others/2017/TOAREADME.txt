Q1 & Q2 counted for 50 each. 


I tried to remember how each question was worded, 
but Q2 in particular was worded very weirdly. 
If you get stuck with Q2 send me a message and I'll explain how I got the answer. 
I didn't solve Q1, but if you want help with that I think Adam solved it.


Good luck for tomorrow guys!
